DenizenSpecializedBot
---------------------

A Discord bot for the Denizen+Citizens Discord, with specialized code that only this Discord users (not to be confused with for example [DenizenMetaBot](https://github.com/DenizenScript/DenizenMetaBot) which is useful for any Denizen-meta-using Discord or [DiscordModBot](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/DiscordModBot) which is just useful to any Discord).

Built using Discord.Net, specifically a fork thereof that enables Forum channel support (pending that PR being pulled into the official version of Discord.Net).

This code is explicitly quick-n-dirty, targeted at exactly what it needs to do with no generics or configuration, on the grounds that no other Discord needs the exact same functions.

As other Discords might want *similar* functionality, this code is released publicly, open source under the MIT license, for anyone to reference or repurpose at will.
